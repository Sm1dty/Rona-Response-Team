# Rona-Response-Team
This is the GitHub Repository for the Rona Response Team's 5523 Group Project. The goal of our project was to analyze the relationship between state policies and the spread of COVID-19, so we could ultimately determine which policies were most effective at combatting the virus.

This repository consists of our data as well as the code used to analyze our data and mine for association rules. The files "all-states-history.csv" and "state-policies.csv" are the two datasets we used in this project in which the former refers to the COVID case data and the latter consists of the policies in place for each state over the course of the pandemic. There is also a jupyter notebook for each state that we analyzed: Texas, California, New York, Minnesota, Vermont, & Oregon.
